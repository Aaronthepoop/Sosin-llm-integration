# Sosin-LLM-Integration

Sosin-LLM-Integration is a project focused on integrating advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) into a variety of educational and research platforms. This initiative leverages open-source frameworks and cutting-edge AI technologies to create tailored solutions for applications in coaching, competitive exam preparation, and knowledge exploration.

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the foundation for Sosin IAS Academy’s AI-powered solutions and beyond, specifically targeting the development of:

1. **AI-as-a-Service (AI-a-a-S):** Customizable AI modules for educational institutions and coaching centers.
2. **LLM Projects:** Dedicated branches for models like BERT, T5, and OpenAI integrations.
3. **Multi-Task Learning Loops:** Enabling long-term strategic AI deployment for diverse tasks.
4. **Anthropology AI Tools:** Specialized modules to enhance learning and teaching in anthropology, leveraging the academy’s expertise.

## Features
- **Custom Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Frameworks:** Optimize LLMs for simultaneous diverse tasks.
- **Open-Source Frameworks:** Initial implementations rely on robust, community-supported technologies.
- **Educational Alignment:** Designed specifically for academic, research, and competitive exam environments.
- **Modular Architecture:** Highly customizable modules for scalability and adaptability.

## Current Branches
- **`main`**: Stable version with core functionality.
- **`Llm_project`**: Dedicated branch for development and testing of LLM integrations.
- **`SosinIndicBert`**: Specialized branch for Indic language and context-specific tasks.
